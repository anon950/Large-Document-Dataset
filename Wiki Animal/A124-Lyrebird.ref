A lyrebird is either of two species of ground-dwelling Australian birds that compose the genus Menura, and the family Menuridae.
They are most notable for their superb ability to mimic natural and artificial sounds from their environment, and the striking beauty of the male bird's huge tail when it is fanned out in courtship display.
Lyrebirds have unique plumes of neutral-coloured tailfeathers and are among Australia's best-known native birds.
== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The classification of lyrebirds was the subject of much debate after the first specimens reached European scientists after 1798.
The superb lyrebird was first illustrated and described scientifically as Menura superba by Major-General Thomas Davies in 1800 to the Linnean Society of London.
He based his work on specimens sent from New South Wales to England.
Lyrebirds were thought to be Galliformes like the broadly similar looking partridge, junglefowl, and pheasants familiar to Europeans, reflected in the early names given to the superb lyrebird, including native pheasant.
They were also called peacock-wrens and Australian birds-of-paradise.
The idea that they were related to the pheasants was abandoned when the first chicks, which are altricial, were described.
They were not classed with the passerines until a paper was published in 1840, 12 years after they were assigned a discrete family, Menuridae.
Within that family they compose a single genus, Menura.It is generally accepted that the lyrebird family is most closely related to the scrub-birds (Atrichornithidae) and some authorities combine both in a single family, but evidence that they are also related to the bowerbirds remains controversial.Lyrebirds are ancient Australian animals: the Australian Museum has fossils of lyrebirds dating back to about 15 million years ago.
The prehistoric Menura tyawanoides has been described from Early Miocene fossils found at the famous Riversleigh site.
=== Species ===
Two species of lyrebird are extant: == Description == The lyrebirds are large passerine birds, amongst the largest in the order.
They are ground living birds with strong legs and feet and short rounded wings.
They are generally poor fliers and rarely take to the air except for periods of downhill gliding.
The superb lyrebird is the larger of the two species.
Females are 74–84 cm long, and the males are a larger 80–98 cm long—making them the third-largest passerine bird after the thick-billed raven and the common raven.
Albert's lyrebird is slightly smaller at a maximum of 90 cm (male) and 84 cm (female) (around 30–35 inches) They have smaller, less spectacular lyrate feathers than the superb lyrebird, but are otherwise similar.
== Distribution and habitat ==
The superb lyrebird is found in areas of rainforest in Victoria, New South Wales, and south-east Queensland.
It is also found in Tasmania where it was introduced in the 19th century.
Many superb lyrebirds live in the Dandenong Ranges National Park and Kinglake National Park around Melbourne, the Royal National Park and Illawarra region south of Sydney, in many other parks along the east coast of Australia, and non protected bushland.
Albert's lyrebird is found only in a small area of Southern Queensland rainforest.
== Behaviour and ecology ==
Lyrebirds are shy and difficult to approach, particularly the Albert's lyrebird, with the result that little information about its behaviour has been documented.
When lyrebirds detect potential danger, they pause and scan the surroundings, sound an alarm, and either flee the area on foot, or seek cover and freeze.
Firefighters sheltering in mine shafts during bushfires have been joined by lyrebirds.
=== Diet and feeding ===
Lyrebirds feed on the ground and as individuals.
A range of invertebrate prey is taken, including insects such as cockroaches, beetles (both adults and larvae), earwigs, fly larvae, and the adults and larvae of moths.
Other prey taken includes centipedes, spiders, earthworms.
Less commonly taken prey includes stick insects, bugs, amphipods, lizards, frogs and occasionally, seeds.
They find food by scratching with their feet through the leaf-litter.
=== Breeding ===
The breeding cycle of the lyrebirds is long, and lyrebirds are long-lived birds, capable of living as long as thirty years.
They also start breeding later in life than other passerine birds.
Female superb lyrebirds start breeding at the age of five or six, and males at the age of six to eight.
Males defend territories from other males, and those territories may contain the breeding territories of up to eight females.
Within the male territories, the males create or use display platforms; for the superb lyrebird, this is a mound of bare soil; for the Albert's lyrebird, it is a pile of twigs on the forest floor.Male lyrebirds call mostly during winter, when they construct and maintain an open arena-mound in dense bush, on which they sing and dance in courtship, to display to potential mates, of which the male lyrebird has several.
The female builds an untidy nest, usually low to the ground in a moist gully, where she lays a single egg.
The egg is incubated over 50 days solely by the female, and the female also fosters the chick alone.
=== Vocalizations and mimicry ===
A lyrebird's song is one of the more distinctive aspects of its behavioural biology.
Lyrebirds sing throughout the year, but the peak of the breeding season, from June to August, is when they sing with the most intensity.
During this peak they may sing for four hours of the day, almost half the hours of daylight.
The song of the superb lyrebird is a mixture of elements of its own song and any number of other mimicked songs and noises.
The lyrebird's syrinx is the most complexly-muscled of the passerines (songbirds), giving the lyrebird extraordinary ability, unmatched in vocal repertoire and mimicry.
Lyrebirds render with great fidelity the individual songs of other birds and the chatter of flocks of birds, and also mimic other animals such as koalas and dingoes.
The lyrebird is capable of imitating almost any sound and they have been recorded mimicking human sounds such as a mill whistle, a cross-cut saw, chainsaws, car engines and car alarms, fire alarms, rifle-shots, camera shutters, dogs barking, crying babies, music, mobile phone ring tones, and even the human voice.
However, while the mimicry of human noises is widely reported, the extent to which it happens is exaggerated and the phenomenon is unusual.The superb lyrebird's mimicked calls are learned from the local environment, including from other superb lyrebirds.
An instructive example is the population of superb lyrebirds in Tasmania, which have retained the calls of species not native to Tasmania in their repertoire, with some local Tasmanian endemic bird songs added.
Young birds take about a year to perfect their mimicked repertoire.
The female lyrebirds of both species are also mimics capable of complex vocalisations.
Superb lyrebird females are often silent during courtship; however, they regularly produce sophisticated vocal displays during foraging and nest defense.
A recording of a superb lyrebird mimicking sounds of an electronic shooting game, workmen and chainsaws was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry in 2013.One researcher, Sydney Curtis, has recorded flute-like lyrebird calls in the vicinity of the New England National Park.
Similarly, in 1969, a park ranger, Neville Fenton, recorded a lyrebird song which resembled flute sounds in the New England National Park, near Dorrigo in northern coastal New South Wales.
After much detective work by Fenton, it was discovered that in the 1930s, a flute player living on a farm adjoining the park used to play tunes near his pet lyrebird.
The lyrebird adopted the tunes into his repertoire, and retained them after release into the park.
Neville Fenton forwarded a tape of his recording to Norman Robinson.
Because a lyrebird is able to carry two tunes at the same time, Robinson filtered out one of the tunes and put it on the phonograph for the purposes of analysis.
One witness suggested that the song represents a modified version of two popular tunes in the 1930s: "The Keel Row" and "Mosquito's Dance".
Musicologist David Rothenberg has endorsed this information.
However, a “flute lyrebird” research group (including Curtis and Fenton) formed to investigate the veracity of this story found no evidence of “Mosquito Dance” and only remnants of “Keel Row” in contemporary and historical lyrebird recordings from this area.
Neither were they able to prove that a lyrebird chick had been a pet, although they acknowledged compelling evidence on both sides of the argument.
== Status and conservation ==
Lyrebirds are not endangered in the short to medium term.
Albert's lyrebird has a very restricted habitat and had been listed as vulnerable by the IUCN, but because the species and its habitat were carefully managed, the species was re-assessed to near threatened in 2009.
The superb lyrebird, once seriously threatened by habitat destruction, is now classified as common.
Even so, lyrebirds are vulnerable to cats and foxes, and it remains to be seen if habitat protection schemes will stand up to increased human population pressure.
== Lyrebird emblems and logos ==
The lyrebird has been featured as a symbol and emblem many times, especially in New South Wales and Victoria (where the superb lyrebird has its natural habitat), and in Queensland (where Albert's lyrebird has its natural habitat).
A male superb lyrebird is featured on the reverse of the Australian 10-cent coin.
A superb lyrebird featured on the Australian one shilling postage stamp first issued in 1932.
A stylised superb lyrebird appears in the transparent window of the Australian 100 dollar note.
A silhouette of a male superb lyrebird is the logo of the Australian Film Commission.
An illustration of a male superb lyrebird, in courtship display, is the emblem of the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service.

A stylised illustration of a male Albert's lyrebird was the logo of the Queensland Conservatorium of Music, before the Conservatorium became part of Griffith University.
In the logo, the top part of the lyrebird's tail became a music stave.
Australian band You Am I's 2008 album Dilettantes and its first single, Erasmus, feature a drawing of a lyrebird by artist Ken Taylor.
A stylised illustration of part of a male superb lyrebird's tail is the logo for the Lyrebird Arts Council of Victoria.
The lyrebird is also featured atop the crest of Panhellenic Sorority Alpha Chi Omega, whose symbol is the lyre.
There are many other companies with the name of Lyrebird, and these also have lyrebird logos.
Land of the Lyrebird is an alternative name for the Strzelecki Ranges in the Gippsland region of Victoria.
== Painting by John Gould ==
The lyrebird is so called because the male bird has a spectacular tail, consisting of 16 highly modified feathers (two long slender lyrates at the centre of the plume, two broader medians on the outside edges and twelve filamentaries arrayed between them), which was originally thought to resemble a lyre.
This happened when a superb lyrebird specimen (which had been taken from Australia to England during the early 19th century) was prepared for display at the British Museum by a taxidermist who had never seen a live lyrebird.
The taxidermist mistakenly thought that the tail would resemble a lyre, and that the tail would be held in a similar way to that of a peacock during courtship display, and so he arranged the feathers in this way.
Later, John Gould (who had also never seen a live lyrebird), painted the lyrebird from the British Museum specimen.
The male lyrebird's tail is not held as in John Gould's painting.
Instead, the male lyrebird's tail is fanned over the lyrebird during courtship display, with the tail completely covering his head and back—as can be seen in the image in the 'breeding' section of this page, and also the image of the 10-cent coin, where the superb lyrebird's tail (in courtship display) is portrayed accurately.
